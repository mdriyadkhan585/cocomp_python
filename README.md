## Introduction

Welcome to the Cocomp documentation! Cocomp is a simulation of a hypothetical computer system with features for memory management, process control, heap allocation, and neural network operations. This document will guide you through understanding and using Cocomp, with examples to help you get started.

## Overview

### Cocomp Components

1. **Memory**: A simulated memory array of 1024 bytes.
2. **Heap**: A memory area of 256 bytes used for dynamic memory allocation.
3. **Page Table**: Manages memory paging with a size of 64 pages.
4. **Neural Network**: Includes input, hidden, and output layers, along with weights and biases.

### Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Push and pop values on a simulated stack, handle page faults.
- **Heap Management**: Allocate and free memory blocks in the heap.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Simulate and respond to interrupts.
- **Neural Network Operations**: Initialize, train, and perform forward and backward passes.

## Getting Started

To start using Cocomp, you need to initialize the `Cocomp` class and then use its methods to interact with the simulated system.

### Basic Usage

Here's a quick guide on how to use Cocomp:

1. **Initialization**:
   Create an instance of the `Cocomp` class.
   ```python
   cocomp = Cocomp()
   ```

2. **Memory and Heap Operations**:
   - **Push to Stack**:
     ```python
     cocomp.push_stack(3.14)
     ```
   - **Pop from Stack**:
     ```python
     value = cocomp.pop_stack()
     print(f"Popped value: {value}")
     ```

3. **Handle Interrupts**:
   ```python
   cocomp.handle_interrupt(0x01)
   ```

4. **Heap Management**:
   - **Allocate Heap**:
     ```python
     cocomp.allocate_heap(10)
     ```
   - **Free Heap**:
     ```python
     cocomp.free_heap(cocomp.heap_pointer, 10)
     ```

5. **Paging Management**:
   ```python
   cocomp.simulate_page_fault(128)
   ```

6. **Print Debug Information**:
   ```python
   cocomp.print_debug_info()
   ```

### Neural Network Operations

1. **Initialize Neural Network**:
   ```python
   cocomp.initialize_neural_network()
   ```

2. **Train Neural Network**:
   ```python
   inputs = np.zeros(INPUT_LAYER_SIZE)
   targets = np.zeros(OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE)
   cocomp.train_neural_network(inputs, targets, num_samples=1, epochs=10)
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Stack Operations

Here's how you can perform basic stack operations:

```python
# Initialize Cocomp
cocomp = Cocomp()

# Push a value to the stack
cocomp.push_stack(42.0)

# Pop the value from the stack
value = cocomp.pop_stack()
print(f"Popped value: {value}")  # Output: Popped value: 42.0
```

### Example 2: Heap Management

To allocate and free heap memory:

```python
# Initialize Cocomp
cocomp = Cocomp()

# Allocate 10 blocks of memory in the heap
cocomp.allocate_heap(10)

# Free the allocated memory
cocomp.free_heap(cocomp.heap_pointer, 10)
```

### Example 3: Neural Network Training

To train a neural network with dummy data:

```python
# Initialize Cocomp and Neural Network
cocomp = Cocomp()
cocomp.initialize_neural_network()

# Define inputs and targets
inputs = np.random.rand(INPUT_LAYER_SIZE)
targets = np.random.rand(OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE)

# Train the network
cocomp.train_neural_network(inputs, targets, num_samples=1, epochs=5)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Dynamic Code Loading

You can load and run dynamic code in Cocomp:

```python
# Initialize Cocomp
cocomp = Cocomp()

# Load a piece of dynamic code
code = np.random.bytes(MEMORY_SIZE)
cocomp.load_dynamic_code(code)
```

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Send and receive IPC messages:

```python
# Initialize Cocomp
cocomp = Cocomp()

# Send IPC message to process 1
cocomp.ipc_send(process_id=1, message=100)

# Receive IPC message from process 1
message = cocomp.ipc_receive(process_id=1)
print(f"Received IPC message: {message}")  # Output: Received IPC message: 100
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Stack Overflow/Underflow**:
  Ensure you are not exceeding the stack limits when pushing or popping values.

- **Heap Allocation Failure**:
  Verify if enough contiguous free blocks are available for allocation.

- **Page Faults**:
  Simulate and handle page faults properly to manage memory paging.

## Conclusion

Cocomp is a versatile tool for simulating a computer system with various features including memory management, process control, and neural network operations. Use this documentation to explore its capabilities and integrate it into your projects.
